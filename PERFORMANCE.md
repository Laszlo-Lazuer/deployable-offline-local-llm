## 💰 Cost Analysis (AWS)

### CPU-Only (c7g.2xlarge)
- **Instance**: 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM
- **Cost**: ~$0.29/hour
- **Queries/hour**: ~8 (at 7 min/query)
- **Cost per query**: ~$0.036

### GPU (g5.xlarge)
- **Instance**: 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, NVIDIA A10G (24GB)
- **Cost**: ~$1.01/hour

## 📝 Recommendations

### Use CPU When:
- Running occasional ad-hoc queries
- GPU not available
- Development/testing environment
- Budget-constrained
- Low query volume

### Use GPU When:
- Production environment with users
- High query volume (>10/hour)
- Interactive applications
- Time-sensitive workloads
- Cost per query matters more than hardware cost

---

## 🧮 Break-Even Analysis

**GPU becomes cost-effective at:**
- **On-premise**: >15 queries/day (based on power costs)
- **AWS**: >25 queries/hour (based on instance pricing)
- **User experience**: Any interactive application (users won't wait 5+ minutes)

## 🎬 Try It Yourself

### Test CPU Mode:
```bash
./start.sh cpu
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What is the median Avg_Price?","filename":"sales-data.csv"}' \
  http://localhost:5001/analyze
# Wait 5+ minutes for result
```

### Test GPU Mode:
```bash
./start.sh gpu
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"What is the median Avg_Price?","filename":"sales-data.csv"}' \
  http://localhost:5001/analyze
# Wait ~1 minute for result
```

### Compare Results:
Both modes produce identical answers - GPU is just faster!

---

**Conclusion**: GPU provides 5-10x speedup for similar cost at scale. For production deployments with interactive users, GPU is strongly recommended.
